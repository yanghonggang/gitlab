# How to fork a project

A fork is a copy of an original repository that you put in another namespace
where you can experiment and apply changes that you can later decide whether or
not to share, without affecting the original project.

It takes just a few steps to [fork a project in GitLab](../user/project/repository/forking_workflow.md#creating-a-fork).
