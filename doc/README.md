## The entire DevOps lifecycle

GitLab is the first single application for software development, security,
and operations that enables [Concurrent DevOps](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/concurrent-devops/),
making the software lifecycle faster and radically improving the speed of business.

GitLab provides solutions for [each of the stages of the DevOps lifecycle](https://about.gitlab.com/stages-devops-lifecycle/):

![DevOps Stages](img/devops-stages-13_3.png)

GitLab is like a top-of-the-line kitchen for making software. As the executive
chef, you decide what software you want to serve. Using your recipe, GitLab handles
all the prep work, cooking, and delivery, so you can turn around orders faster
than ever.

The following sections provide links to documentation for each DevOps stage:

### Verify

Spot errors sooner, improve security and shorten feedback cycles with built-in
static code analysis, code testing, code quality, dependency checking, and Review
Apps. Customize your approval workflow controls, automatically test the quality
of your code, and spin up a staging environment for every code change.

GitLab Continuous Integration is the most popular next generation testing system that
scales to run your tests faster.

The following documentation relates to the DevOps **Verify** stage:

for a variety of common package managers. Users are able to build and publish
packages, which can be consumed as a dependency in downstream projects.

The following documentation relates to the DevOps **Package** stage:

### Secure

Check your application for security vulnerabilities that may lead to unauthorized access, data
leaks, or denial of service. GitLab can perform static and dynamic tests on your application's code,
looking for known flaws and reporting them in the merge request. You can then fix flaws prior to
merge. Security teams can use dashboards to get a high-level view on projects and groups, and start
remediation processes when needed.

The following documentation relates to the DevOps **Secure** stage:

### Monitor

Ensure your applications are always responsive and available.

GitLab collects and displays performance metrics for deployed applications so you can know in an
instant how code changes impact your production environment.

### Defend

GitLab Defend enables organizations to proactively protect cloud-native environments by providing
context-aware technologies to reduce overall security risk. Defend is a natural extension of your
existing operation's practices and provides security visibility across the entire DevSecOps
lifecycle. This visibility empowers your organization to apply DevSecOps best practices from the
first line of code written and extends all the way through to greater monitoring and protection for
your applications that are deployed in production.

The following documentation relates to the DevOps **Defend** stage:

| Defend topics                                                                                | Description                                                                          |
