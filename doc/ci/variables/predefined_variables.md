# Predefined environment variables reference

For an introduction on this subject, read through the
[getting started with environment variables](README.md) document.

Some of the predefined environment variables are available only if a minimum
version of [GitLab Runner](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/) is used. Consult the table below to find the
version of GitLab Runner that's required.

NOTE: **Note:**
Starting with GitLab 9.0, we have deprecated some variables. Read the
[9.0 Renaming](deprecated_variables.md#gitlab-90-renamed-variables) section to find out their replacements.
**To avoid problems with deprecated and removed variables in future releases, you are strongly advised to use the new variables.**

You can add a command to your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file to
[output the values of all variables available for a job](README.md#list-all-environment-variables).

Kubernetes-specific environment variables are detailed in the
[Kubernetes deployment variables](../../user/project/clusters/index.md#deployment-variables) section.
