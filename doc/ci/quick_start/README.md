# Get started with GitLab CI/CD

Use this document to get started with
GitLab [continuous integration](https://about.gitlab.com/stages-devops-lifecycle/continuous-integration/).

Before you start, make sure you have:

- A project in GitLab that you would like to use CI/CD for.
- Maintainer or owner access for the project.

If you are migrating from another CI/CD tool, view this documentation:

- [Migrate from CircleCI](../migration/circleci.md).
- [Migrate from Jenkins](../migration/jenkins.md).

## CI/CD process overview

To use GitLab CI/CD:

1. [Ensure you have runners available](#ensure-you-have-runners-available) to run your jobs.
   If you don't have a runner, [install GitLab Runner](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/)
   and [register a runner](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/register/) for your instance, project, or group.
1. [Create a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file](#create-a-gitlab-ciyml-file)
   at the root of your repository. This file is where you define your CI/CD jobs.

When you commit the file to your repository, the runner runs your jobs.
The job results [are displayed in a pipeline](#view-the-status-of-your-pipeline-and-jobs).

### Ensure you have runners available

In GitLab, runners are agents that run your CI/CD jobs.

You might already have runners available for your project, including
[shared runners](../runners/README.md#shared-runners), which are
available to all projects in your GitLab instance.

To view available runners:

- Go to **Settings > CI/CD** and expand **Runners**.

As long as you have at least one runner that's active, with a green circle next to it,
you have a runner available to process your jobs.

If no runners are listed on the **Runners** page in the UI, you or an administrator
must [install GitLab Runner](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/) and
[register](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/register/) at least one runner.

If you are testing CI/CD, you can install GitLab Runner and register runners on your local machine.
When your CI/CD jobs run, they run on your local machine.

### Create a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file

The `.gitlab-ci.yml` file is a [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) file where
you configure specific instructions for GitLab CI/CD.

In this file, you define:

- The structure and order of jobs that the runner should execute.
- The decisions the runner should make when specific conditions are encountered.

For example, you might want to run a suite of tests when you commit to
any branch except `master`. When you commit to `master`, you want
to run the same suite, but also publish your application.

All of this is defined in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.

To create a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file:

1. Go to **Project overview > Details**.
1. Above the file list, select the branch you want to commit to,
   click the plus icon, then select **New file**:

   ![New file](img/new_file_v13_6.png)

1. For the **File name** type `.gitlab-ci.yml` and in the larger window,
   paste this sample code:

   ```yaml
   build-job:
     stage: build
     script:
       - echo "Hello, $GITLAB_USER_LOGIN!"

   test-job1:
     stage: test
     script:
       - echo "This job tests something"

   test-job2:
     stage: test
     script:
       - echo "This job tests something, but takes more time than test-job1."
       - echo "After the echo commands complete, it runs the sleep command for 20 seconds"
       - echo "which simulates a test that runs 20 seconds longer than test-job1"
       - sleep 20

   deploy-prod:
     stage: deploy
     script:
       - echo "This job deploys something from the $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH branch."
   ```

   `$GITLAB_USER_LOGIN` and `$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH` are
   [predefined variables](../variables/predefined_variables.md)
   that populate when the job runs.

1. Click **Commit changes**.

The pipeline starts when the commit is committed.

#### `.gitlab-ci.yml` tips

- If you want the runner to use a Docker image to run the jobs, edit the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file
  to include your image name:

  ```yaml
  default:
    image: ruby:2.7.2
  ```

  This command tells the runner to use a Ruby image from Docker Hub.

- To validate your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file, use the
  [CI Lint tool](../lint.md), which is available in every project.
- You can also use [CI/CD configuration visualization](../yaml/visualization.md) to
  view a graphical representation of your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.
- For the complete `.gitlab-ci.yml` syntax, see
  [the `.gitlab-ci.yml` reference topic](../yaml/README.md).

### View the status of your pipeline and jobs

When you committed your changes, a pipeline started.

To view your pipeline:

- Go **CI/CD > Pipelines**.

  A pipeline with three stages should be displayed:

  ![Three stages](img/three_stages_v13_6.png)

- To view a visual representation of your pipeline, click the pipeline ID.

  ![Pipeline graph](img/pipeline_graph_v13_6.png)

- To view details of a job, click the job name, for example, `deploy-prod`.

  ![Job details](img/job_details_v13_6.png)

If the job status is `stuck`, check to ensure a runner is probably configured for the project.
