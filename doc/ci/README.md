# GitLab CI/CD

GitLab CI/CD is a tool built into GitLab for software development
through the [continuous methodologies](introduction/index.md#introduction-to-cicd-methodologies):

- Continuous Integration (CI)
- Continuous Delivery (CD)
- Continuous Deployment (CD)

TIP: **Tip:**
Out-of-the-box management systems can decrease hours spent on maintaining toolchains by 10% or more.
Watch our ["Mastering continuous software development"](https://about.gitlab.com/webcast/mastering-ci-cd/)
webcast to learn about continuous methods and how GitLabâ€™s built-in CI can help you simplify and scale software development.

## Overview

Continuous Integration works by pushing small code chunks to your
application's codebase hosted in a Git repository, and to every
push, run a pipeline of scripts to build, test, and validate the
code changes before merging them into the main branch.

Continuous Delivery and Deployment consist of a step further CI,
deploying your application to production at every
push to the default branch of the repository.

These methodologies allow you to catch bugs and errors early in
the development cycle, ensuring that all the code deployed to
production complies with the code standards you established for
your app.

For a complete overview of these methodologies and GitLab CI/CD,
read the [Introduction to CI/CD with GitLab](introduction/index.md).

## Getting started

GitLab CI/CD is configured by a file called `.gitlab-ci.yml` placed
at the repository's root. This file creates a [pipeline](pipelines/index.md), which runs for changes to the code in the repository. Pipelines consist of one or more stages that run in order and can each contain one or more jobs that run in parallel. These jobs (or scripts) get executed by the [GitLab Runner](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/) agent.

To get started with GitLab CI/CD, we recommend you read through
the following documents:

- [How GitLab CI/CD works](introduction/index.md#how-gitlab-cicd-works).
- [Fundamental pipeline architectures](pipelines/pipeline_architectures.md).
- [GitLab CI/CD basic workflow](introduction/index.md#basic-cicd-workflow).
- [Step-by-step guide for writing `.gitlab-ci.yml` for the first time](../user/project/pages/getting_started/pages_from_scratch.md).

If you're migrating from another CI/CD tool, check out our handy references:

- [Migrating from CircleCI](migration/circleci.md)
- [Migrating from Jenkins](migration/jenkins.md)

You can also get started by using one of the
[`.gitlab-ci.yml` templates](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/tree/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates)
available through the UI. You can use them by creating a new file,
choosing a template that suits your application, and adjusting it
to your needs:

![Use a `.gitlab-ci.yml` template](img/add_file_template_11_10.png)

While building your `.gitlab-ci.yml`, you can use the [CI/CD configuration visualization](yaml/visualization.md) to facilate your writing experience.

For a broader overview, see the [CI/CD getting started](quick_start/README.md) guide.

Once you're familiar with how GitLab CI/CD works, see the
[`.gitlab-ci.yml` full reference](yaml/README.md)
for all the attributes you can set and use.

GitLab CI/CD and [shared runners](runners/README.md#shared-runners) are enabled on GitLab.com and available for all users, limited only by the [pipeline quota](../user/gitlab_com/index.md#shared-runners).

## Concepts
