# Accessibility & Readability

## Resources

[Chrome Accessibility Developer Tools](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/accessibility-developer-tools)
are useful for testing for potential accessibility problems in GitLab.

The [axe](https://www.deque.com/axe/) browser extension (available for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/axe-devtools/) and [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/axe-web-accessibility-tes/lhdoppojpmngadmnindnejefpokejbdd)) is
also a handy tool for running audits and getting feedback on markup, CSS and even potentially problematic color usages.

Accessibility best-practices and more in-depth information are available on
[the Audit Rules page](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/accessibility-developer-tools/wiki/Audit-Rules) for the Chrome Accessibility Developer Tools. The [Awesome Accessibility](https://github.com/brunopulis/awesome-a11y) list is also a
useful compilation of accessibility-related material.
