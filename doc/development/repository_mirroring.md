# Repository mirroring

## Deep Dive

In December 2018, Tiago Botelho hosted a Deep Dive (GitLab team members only: `https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/create-stage/issues/1`)
on GitLab's [Pull Repository Mirroring functionality](../user/project/repository/repository_mirroring.md#pulling-from-a-remote-repository)
to share his domain specific knowledge with anyone who may work in this part of the
code base in the future. You can find the [recording on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSZq0fpdY-Y),
and the slides in [PDF](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/create-stage/uploads/8693404888a941fd851f8a8ecdec9675/Gitlab_Create_-_Pull_Mirroring_Deep_Dive.pdf).
Everything covered in this deep dive was accurate as of GitLab 11.6, and while specific
details may have changed since then, it should still serve as a good introduction.
