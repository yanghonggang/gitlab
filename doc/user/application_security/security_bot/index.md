# Security Bot

The GitLab Security Bot `@GitLab-Security-Bot` is an internal user that automatically creates remediation merge requests
to fix vulnerabilities in your projects whenever a solution is available.

To stop the bot from creating remediation merge requests, disable the auto-fix settings in your
project's security configuration. Read more about it in the
[Auto-fix merge requests](../index.md#auto-fix-merge-requests) section.
