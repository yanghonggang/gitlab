# Project integrations

You can find the available integrations under your project's
**Settings âž” Integrations** page. You need to have at least
[maintainer permission](../../permissions.md) on the project.

## Integrations

Integrations allow you to integrate GitLab with other applications.
They are a bit like plugins in that they allow a lot of freedom in
adding functionality to GitLab.

## Project webhooks

Project webhooks allow you to trigger a URL if for example new code is pushed or
a new issue is created. You can configure webhooks to listen for specific events
like pushes, issues or merge requests. GitLab will send a POST request with data
to the webhook URL.
