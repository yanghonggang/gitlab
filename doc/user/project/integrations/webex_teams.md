1. Enter a name for the webhook and select the space to receive the notifications.
1. Click **ADD**.

## Configure settings in GitLab

Once you have a webhook URL for your Webex Teams space, you can configure GitLab to send notifications.

1. Navigate to **Project > Settings > Integrations**.
1. Select the **Webex Teams** integration.
1. Ensure that the **Active** toggle is enabled.
1. Select the checkboxes corresponding to the GitLab events you want to receive in Webex Teams.
