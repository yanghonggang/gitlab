# Reduce repository size

Git repositories become larger over time. When large files are added to a Git repository:

- Fetching the repository becomes slower because everyone must download the files.
- They take up a large amount of storage space on the server.
- Git repository storage limits [can be reached](#storage-limits).

Rewriting a repository can remove unwanted history to make the repository smaller.
We **recommend [`git filter-repo`](https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo/blob/main/README.md)**
over [`git filter-branch`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-filter-branch) and
[BFG](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/).

DANGER: **Warning:**
Rewriting repository history is a destructive operation. Make sure to back up your repository before
you begin. The best way back up a repository is to
[export the project](../settings/import_export.md#exporting-a-project-and-its-data).

NOTE: **Note:**
Git LFS files can only be removed by an Administrator using a
[Rake task](../../../raketasks/cleanup.md). Removal of this limitation
[is planned](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/223621).

## Purge files from repository history

To reduce the size of your repository in GitLab, you must remove references to large files from branches, tags, and
other internal references (refs) that are automatically created by GitLab. These refs include:

- `refs/merge-requests/*` for merge requests.
- `refs/pipelines/*` for
  [pipelines](../../../ci/troubleshooting.md#fatal-reference-is-not-a-tree-error).
- `refs/environments/*` for environments.

Git doesn't usually download these refs to make cloning and fetch faster, but we can use the `--mirror` option to
download all the advertised refs.

1. [Install `git filter-repo`](https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo/blob/main/INSTALL.md)
   using a supported package manager or from source.

1. Clone a fresh copy of the repository using `--bare` and `--mirror`:

   ```shell
   git clone --bare --mirror https://gitlab.example.com/my/project.git
   ```

1. Using `git filter-repo`, purge any files from the history of your repository.

   To purge large files, the `--strip-blobs-bigger-than` option can be used:

   ```shell
   git filter-repo --strip-blobs-bigger-than 10M
   ```

   To purge large files stored using Git LFS, the `--blob--callback` option can
   be used. The example below, uses the callback to read the file size from the
   Git LFS pointer, and removes files larger than 10MB.

   ```shell
   git filter-repo --blob-callback '
     if blob.data.startswith(b"version https://git-lfs.github.com/spec/v1"):
       size_in_bytes = int.from_bytes(blob.data[124:], byteorder="big")
       if size_in_bytes > 10*1000:
         blob.skip()
     '
   ```

   To purge specific large files by path, the `--path` and `--invert-paths` options can be combined:

   ```shell
   git filter-repo --path path/to/big/file.m4v --invert-paths
   ```

   See the
   [`git filter-repo` documentation](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo/blob/docs/html/git-filter-repo.html#EXAMPLES)
   for more examples and the complete documentation.

1. Force push your changes to overwrite all branches on GitLab:

   ```shell
   git push origin --force 'refs/heads/*'
   ```

   [Protected branches](../protected_branches.md) cause this to fail. To proceed, you must
   remove branch protection, push, and then re-enable protected branches.

1. To remove large files from tagged releases, force push your changes to all tags on GitLab:

   ```shell
   git push origin --force 'refs/tags/*'
   ```

   [Protected tags](../protected_tags.md) cause this to fail. To proceed, you must remove tag
   protection, push, and then re-enable protected tags.

1. To prevent dead links to commits that no longer exist, push the `refs/replace` created by `git filter-repo`.

   ```shell
   git push origin --force 'refs/replace/*'
   ```

   Refer to the Git [`replace`](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Replace) documentation for information on how this works.

1. Run a [repository cleanup](#repository-cleanup).

NOTE: **Note:**
Project statistics are cached for performance. You may need to wait 5-10 minutes
to see a reduction in storage utilization.

## Purge files from GitLab storage

In addition to the refs mentioned above, GitLab also creates hidden `refs/keep-around/*`to prevent commits being deleted. Hidden refs are not advertised, which means we can't download them using Git, but these refs are included in a project export.

To purge files from GitLab storage:

1. [Install `git filter-repo`](https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo/blob/main/INSTALL.md)
   using a supported package manager or from source.

1. Generate a fresh [export from the
   project](../settings/import_export.html#exporting-a-project-and-its-data) and download it.

1. Decompress the backup using `tar`:

   ```shell
   tar xzf project-backup.tar.gz
   ```

   This contains a `project.bundle` file, which was created by
   [`git bundle`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bundle).

1. Clone a fresh copy of the repository from the bundle:

   ```shell
   git clone --bare --mirror /path/to/project.bundle
   ```

1. Using `git filter-repo`, purge any files from the history of your repository. Because we are
   trying to remove internal refs, we rely on the `commit-map` produced by each run to tell us
   which internal refs to remove.

   NOTE: **Note:**
   `git filter-repo` creates a new `commit-map` file every run, and overwrite the `commit-map` from
   the previous run. You need this file from **every** run. Do the next step every time you run
   `git filter-repo`.

   To purge all large files, the `--strip-blobs-bigger-than` option can be used:

   ```shell
   git filter-repo --strip-blobs-bigger-than 10M
   ```

   To purge specific large files by path, the `--path` and `--invert-paths` options can be combined.

   ```shell
   git filter-repo --path path/to/big/file.m4v --invert-paths
   ```

   See the
   [`git filter-repo` documentation](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo/blob/docs/html/git-filter-repo.html#EXAMPLES)
   for more examples and the complete documentation.

1. Because cloning from a bundle file sets the `origin` remote to the local bundle file, delete this `origin` remote, and set it to the URL to your repository:

   ```shell
   git remote remove origin
   git remote add origin https://gitlab.example.com/<namespace>/<project_name>.git
   ```

1. Force push your changes to overwrite all branches on GitLab:

   ```shell
   git push origin --force 'refs/heads/*'
   ```

   [Protected branches](../protected_branches.md) cause this to fail. To proceed, you must
   remove branch protection, push, and then re-enable protected branches.

1. To remove large files from tagged releases, force push your changes to all tags on GitLab:

   ```shell
   git push origin --force 'refs/tags/*'
   ```

   [Protected tags](../protected_tags.md) cause this to fail. To proceed, you must remove tag
   protection, push, and then re-enable protected tags.

1. To prevent dead links to commits that no longer exist, push the `refs/replace` created by `git filter-repo`.

   ```shell
   git push origin --force 'refs/replace/*'
   ```

   Refer to the Git [`replace`](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Replace) documentation for information on how this works.

1. Run a [repository cleanup](#repository-cleanup).

## Repository cleanup

NOTE: **Note:**
Safely cleaning the repository requires it to be made read-only for the duration
of the operation. This happens automatically, but submitting the cleanup request
fails if any writes are ongoing, so cancel any outstanding `git push`
operations before continuing.

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/issues/19376) in GitLab 11.6.

Repository cleanup allows you to upload a text file of objects and GitLab removes internal Git
references to these objects. You can use
[`git filter-repo`](https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo) to produce a list of objects (in a
`commit-map` file) that can be used with repository cleanup.

To clean up a repository:

1. Go to the project for the repository.
1. Navigate to **Settings > Repository**.
1. Upload a list of objects. For example, a `commit-map` file created by `git filter-repo` which is located in the
   `filter-repo` directory.

   If your `commit-map` file is larger than 10MB, the file can be split and uploaded piece by piece:

   ```shell
   split -l 100000 filter-repo/commit-map filter-repo/commit-map-
   ```

1. Click **Start cleanup**.

This:

- Removes any internal Git references to old commits.
- Runs `git gc` against the repository to remove unreferenced objects. Repacking your repository temporarily
  causes the size of your repository to increase significantly, because the old pack files are not removed until the
  new pack files have been created.
- Unlinks any unused LFS objects currently attached to your project, freeing up storage space.
- Recalculates the size of your repository on disk.

GitLab sends an email notification with the recalculated repository size after the cleanup has completed.

When using repository cleanup, note:

- Project statistics are cached. You may need to wait 5-10 minutes to see a reduction in storage utilization.
- Housekeeping prunes loose objects older than 2 weeks. This means objects added in the last 2 weeks
  are not be removed immediately. If you have access to the
  [Gitaly](../../../administration/gitaly/index.md) server, you may run `git gc --prune=now` to
  prune all loose objects immediately.
- This process removes some copies of the rewritten commits from GitLab's cache and database,
  but there are still numerous gaps in coverage and some of the copies may persist indefinitely.
  [Clearing the instance cache](../../../administration/raketasks/maintenance.md#clear-redis-cache)
  may help to remove some of them, but it should not be depended on for security purposes!

## Storage limits

Repository size limits:

- Can [be set by an administrator](../../admin_area/settings/account_and_limit_settings.md#account-and-limit-settings)
  on self-managed instances. **(STARTER ONLY)**
- Are [set for GitLab.com](../../gitlab_com/index.md#account-and-limit-settings).

When a project has reached its size limit, you cannot:

- Push to the project.
- Create a new merge request.
- Merge existing merge requests.
- Upload LFS objects.

You can still:

- Create new issues.
- Clone the project.

If you exceed the repository size limit, you can:

1. Remove some data.
1. Make a new commit.
1. Push back to the repository.

If these actions are insufficient, you can also:

- Move some blobs to LFS.
- Remove some old dependency updates from history.

Unfortunately, this workflow doesn't work. Deleting files in a commit doesn't actually reduce the
size of the repository, because the earlier commits and blobs still exist. Instead, you must rewrite
history. We recommend the open-source community-maintained tool
[`git filter-repo`](https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo).

NOTE: **Note:**
Until `git gc` runs on the GitLab side, the "removed" commits and blobs still exist. You also
must be able to push the rewritten history to GitLab, which may be impossible if you've already
exceeded the maximum size limit.

In order to lift these restrictions, the administrator of the self-managed GitLab instance must
increase the limit on the particular project that exceeded it. Therefore, it's always better to
proactively stay underneath the limit. If you hit the limit, and can't have it temporarily
increased, your only option is to:

1. Prune all the unneeded stuff locally.
1. Create a new project on GitLab and start using that instead.

CAUTION: **Caution:**
This process is not suitable for removing sensitive data like password or keys from your repository.
Information about commits, including file content, is cached in the database, and remain
visible even after they have been removed from the repository.

## Troubleshooting

### Incorrect repository statistics shown in the GUI

If the displayed size or commit number is different from the exported `.tar.gz` or local repository,
you can ask a GitLab administrator to [force an update](../../../administration/troubleshooting/gitlab_rails_cheat_sheet.md#incorrect-repository-statistics-shown-in-the-gui).
