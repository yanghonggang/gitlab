# Bulk editing issues, epics, and merge requests at the group level **(PREMIUM)**

NOTE: **Note:**
Bulk editing issues and merge requests is also available at the **project level**.
For more details, see [Bulk editing issues and merge requests at the project level](../../project/bulk_editing.md).

If you want to update attributes across multiple issues, epics, or merge requests in a group, you
can do it by bulk editing them, that is, editing them together.

NOTE: **Note:**
Only the items visible on the current page are selected for bulk editing (up to 20).
