# User account

Each GitLab account has a user profile, and settings. Your [profile](#user-profile)
contains information about you, and your GitLab activity. Your [settings](#profile-settings)
allow you to customize some aspects of GitLab to suit yourself.

## Creating users

There are several ways to create users on GitLab. See the [creating users documentation](account/create_accounts.md) for more details.

## Signing in

There are several ways to sign into your GitLab account.
See the [authentication topic](../../topics/authentication/index.md) for more details.

### Unknown sign-in

GitLab notifies you if a sign-in occurs that is from an unknown IP address or device.
See [Unknown Sign-In Notification](unknown_sign_in_notification.md) for more details.

## Changing your username

Your `username` is a unique [`namespace`](../group/index.md#namespaces)
related to your user ID. Changing it can have unintended side effects, read
[how redirects behave](../project/index.md#redirects-when-changing-repository-paths)
before proceeding.

To change your `username`:

1. Navigate to your [profile's](#profile-settings) **Settings > Account**.
1. Enter a new username under **Change username**.
1. Click **Update username**.

CAUTION: **Caution:**
It is currently not possible to change your username if it contains a
project with [Container Registry](../packages/container_registry/index.md) tags,
because the project cannot be moved.

TIP: **Tip:**
If you want to retain ownership over the original namespace and
protect the URL redirects, then instead of changing a group's path or renaming a
username, you can create a new group and transfer projects to it.
Alternatively, you can follow [this detailed procedure from the GitLab Team Handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/tools-and-tips/#how-to-change-your-username-at-gitlabcom)
which also covers the case where you have projects hosted with
[GitLab Pages](../project/pages/index.md).

## Current status

> Introduced in GitLab 11.2.

You can provide a custom status message for your user profile along with an emoji that describes it.
This may be helpful when you are out of office or otherwise not available.
Other users can then take your status into consideration when responding to your issues or assigning work to you.
Please be aware that your status is publicly visible even if your [profile is private](#private-profile).

Status messages are restricted to 100 characters of plain text.
They may however contain emoji codes such as `I'm on vacation :palm_tree:`.

To set your current status:

1. Click your avatar.
1. Click **Set status**, or **Edit status** if you have already set a status.
1. Set the desired emoji and/or status message.
1. Click **Set status**. Alternatively, you can click **Remove status** to remove your user status entirely.

![Busy status indicator](img/busy_status_indicator_v13_6.png)

or

1. Click your avatar.
1. Select **Profile**.
1. Click **Edit profile** (pencil icon).
1. Enter your status message in the **Your status** text field.
   1. Alternatively, select the **Busy** checkbox ([Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/259649) in GitLab 13.6}.
1. Click **Add status emoji** (smiley face), and select the desired emoji.
1. Click **Update profile settings**.

You can also set your current status [using the API](../../api/users.md#user-status).

If you previously selected the "Busy" checkbox, remember to deselect it when you become available again.

## Commit email

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/merge_requests/21598) in GitLab 11.4.

A commit email is an email address displayed in every Git-related action carried out through the GitLab interface.

Any of your own verified email addresses can be used as the commit email.

To change your commit email:

1. Click your avatar.
1. Select **Profile**.
1. Click **Edit profile** (pencil icon).
1. Click **Commit email** dropdown.
1. Select any of the verified emails.
1. Click **Update profile settings**.

### Private commit email

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/merge_requests/22560) in GitLab 11.5.

GitLab provides the user with an automatically generated private commit email option,
which allows the user to keep their email information private.

To enable this option:

1. Click your avatar.
1. Select **Profile**.
1. Click **Edit profile** (pencil icon).
1. Click **Commit email** dropdown.
1. Select **Use a private email** option.
1. Click **Update profile settings**.

Once this option is enabled, every Git-related action is performed using the private commit email.

To stay fully anonymous, you can also copy this private commit email
and configure it on your local machine using the following command:

```shell
git config --global user.email <your email address>
```

## Troubleshooting

### Why do I keep getting signed out?

When signing in to the main GitLab application, a `_gitlab_session` cookie is
set. `_gitlab_session` is cleared client-side when you close your browser
and expires after "Application settings -> Session duration (minutes)"/`session_expire_delay`
(defaults to `10080` minutes = 7 days).

When signing in to the main GitLab application, you can also check the
"Remember me" option which sets the `remember_user_token`
cookie (via [`devise`](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise)).
`remember_user_token` expires after
`config/initializers/devise.rb` -> `config.remember_for` (defaults to 2 weeks).

When the `_gitlab_session` expires or isn't available, GitLab uses the `remember_user_token`
to get you a new `_gitlab_session` and keep you signed in through browser restarts.

After your `remember_user_token` expires and your `_gitlab_session` is cleared/expired,
you are asked to sign in again to verify your identity for security reasons.

NOTE: **Note:**
When any session is signed out, or when a session is revoked
via [Active Sessions](active_sessions.md), all **Remember me** tokens are revoked.
While other sessions will remain active, the **Remember me** feature will not restore
a session if the browser is closed or the existing session expires.

### Increased sign-in time

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/20340) in GitLab 13.1.

The `remember_user_token` lifetime of a cookie can now extend beyond the deadline set by `config.remember_for`, as the `config.extend_remember_period` flag is now set to true.

GitLab uses both session and persistent cookies:

- Session cookie: Session cookies are normally removed at the end of the browser session when the browser is closed. The `_gitlab_session` cookie has no expiration date.
- Persistent cookie: The `remember_user_token` is a cookie with an expiration date of two weeks. GitLab activates this cookie if you click Remember Me when you sign in.

By default, the server sets a time-to-live (TTL) of 1-week on any session that is used.

When you close a browser, the session cookie may still remain. For example, Chrome has the "Continue where you left off" option that restores session cookies.
In other words, as long as you access GitLab at least once every 2 weeks, you could remain signed in with GitLab, as long as your browser tab is open.
The server continues to reset the TTL for that session, independent of whether 2FA is installed,
If you close your browser and open it up again, the `remember_user_token` cookie allows your user to reauthenticate itself.

Without the `config.extend_remember_period` flag, you would be forced to sign in again after two weeks.

<!-- ## Troubleshooting

Include any troubleshooting steps that you can foresee. If you know beforehand what issues
one might have when setting this up, or when something is changed, or on upgrading, it's
important to describe those, too. Think of things that may go wrong and include them here.
This is important to minimize requests for support, and to avoid doc comments with
questions that you know someone might ask.

Each scenario can be a third-level heading, e.g. `### Getting error message X`.
If you have none to add when creating a doc, leave this section in place
but commented out to help encourage others to add to it in the future. -->
