# Stages of Auto DevOps

The following sections describe the stages of [Auto DevOps](index.md).
Read them carefully to understand how each one works.

## Auto Build

Auto Build creates a build of the application using an existing `Dockerfile` or
Heroku buildpacks. The resulting Docker image is pushed to the
[Container Registry](../../user/packages/container_registry/index.md), and tagged
with the commit SHA or tag.

### Auto Build using a Dockerfile

If a project's repository contains a `Dockerfile` at its root, Auto Build uses
`docker build` to create a Docker image.

If you're also using Auto Review Apps and Auto Deploy, and you choose to provide
your own `Dockerfile`, you must either:

- Expose your application to port `5000`, as the
  [default Helm chart](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cluster-integration/auto-deploy-image/-/tree/master/assets/auto-deploy-app)
  assumes this port is available.
- Override the default values by
  [customizing the Auto Deploy Helm chart](customize.md#custom-helm-chart).

### Auto Build using Heroku buildpacks

Auto Build builds an application using a project's `Dockerfile` if present. If no
`Dockerfile` is present, it uses [Herokuish](https://github.com/gliderlabs/herokuish)
and [Heroku buildpacks](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks)
to detect and build the application into a Docker image.

Each buildpack requires your project's repository to contain certain files for
Auto Build to build your application successfully. For example, your application's
root directory must contain the appropriate file for your application's
language:

- For Python projects, a `Pipfile` or `requirements.txt` file.
- For Ruby projects, a `Gemfile` or `Gemfile.lock` file.

For the requirements of other languages and frameworks, read the
[Heroku buildpacks documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks#officially-supported-buildpacks).

TIP: **Tip:**
If Auto Build fails despite the project meeting the buildpack requirements, set
a project variable `TRACE=true` to enable verbose logging, which may help you
troubleshoot.

### Auto Build using Cloud Native Buildpacks (beta)

> Introduced in [GitLab 12.10](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/28165).

Auto Build supports building your application using [Cloud Native Buildpacks](https://buildpacks.io)
through the [`pack` command](https://github.com/buildpacks/pack). To use Cloud Native Buildpacks,
set the CI variable `AUTO_DEVOPS_BUILD_IMAGE_CNB_ENABLED` to a non-empty
value. The default builder is `heroku/buildpacks:18` but a different builder
can be selected using the CI variable `AUTO_DEVOPS_BUILD_IMAGE_CNB_BUILDER`.

Cloud Native Buildpacks (CNBs) are an evolution of Heroku buildpacks, and
will eventually supersede Herokuish-based builds within Auto DevOps. For more
information, see [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/212692).

Builds using Cloud Native Buildpacks support the same options as builds using
Heroku buildpacks, with the following caveats:

- The buildpack must be a Cloud Native Buildpack. A Heroku buildpack can be
  converted to a Cloud Native Buildpack using Heroku's
  [`cnb-shim`](https://github.com/heroku/cnb-shim).
- `BUILDPACK_URL` must be in a form
  [supported by `pack`](https://buildpacks.io/docs/app-developer-guide/specific-buildpacks/).
- The `/bin/herokuish` command is not present in the resulting image, and prefixing
  commands with `/bin/herokuish procfile exec` is no longer required (nor possible).

NOTE: **Note:**
Auto Test still uses Herokuish, as test suite detection is not
yet part of the Cloud Native Buildpack specification. For more information, see
[this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/212689).

## Auto Test

Auto Test runs the appropriate tests for your application using
[Herokuish](https://github.com/gliderlabs/herokuish) and
[Heroku buildpacks](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks) by analyzing
your project to detect the language and framework. Several languages and
frameworks are detected automatically, but if your language is not detected,
you may be able to create a [custom buildpack](customize.md#custom-buildpacks).
Check the [currently supported languages](#currently-supported-languages).

Auto Test uses tests you already have in your application. If there are no
tests, it's up to you to add them.

NOTE: **Note:**
Not all buildpacks supported by [Auto Build](#auto-build) are supported by Auto Test.
Auto Test uses [Herokuish](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/212689), *not*
Cloud Native Buildpacks, and only buildpacks that implement the
[Testpack API](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/testpack-api) are supported.

### Currently supported languages

Note that not all buildpacks support Auto Test yet, as it's a relatively new
enhancement. All of Heroku's
[officially supported languages](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-ci#supported-languages)
support Auto Test. The languages supported by Heroku's Herokuish buildpacks all
support Auto Test, but notably the multi-buildpack does not.

The supported buildpacks are:

```plaintext
- heroku-buildpack-multi
- heroku-buildpack-ruby
- heroku-buildpack-nodejs
- heroku-buildpack-clojure
- heroku-buildpack-python
- heroku-buildpack-java
- heroku-buildpack-gradle
- heroku-buildpack-scala
- heroku-buildpack-play
- heroku-buildpack-php
- heroku-buildpack-go
- buildpack-nginx
```

If your application needs a buildpack that is not in the above list, you
might want to use a [custom buildpack](customize.md#custom-buildpacks).

## Auto Code Quality

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/1984) in [GitLab Starter](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/) 9.3.
> - Made [available in all tiers](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/212499) in GitLab 13.2.

Auto Code Quality uses the
[Code Quality image](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ci-cd/codequality) to run
static analysis and other code checks on the current code. After creating the
report, it's uploaded as an artifact which you can later download and check
out. The merge request widget also displays any
[differences between the source and target branches](../../user/project/merge_requests/code_quality.md).

## Auto SAST

> - Introduced in [GitLab Ultimate](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/) 10.3.
> - Select functionality made available in all tiers beginning in 13.1

Static Application Security Testing (SAST) uses the
[SAST Docker image](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/sast) to run static
analysis on the current code, and checks for potential security issues. The
Auto SAST stage will be skipped on licenses other than
[Ultimate](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/), and requires
[GitLab Runner](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/) 11.5 or above.

After creating the report, it's uploaded as an artifact which you can later
download and check out. The merge request widget also displays any security
warnings.

To learn more about [how SAST works](../../user/application_security/sast/index.md),
see the documentation.

## Auto Secret Detection

> - Introduced in [GitLab Ultimate](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/) 13.1.
> - [Select functionality made available in all tiers](../../user/application_security/secret_detection/#making-secret-detection-available-to-all-gitlab-tiers) in 13.3

Secret Detection uses the
[Secret Detection Docker image](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/secrets) to run Secret Detection on the current code, and checks for leaked secrets. Auto Secret Detection requires [GitLab Runner](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/) 11.5 or above.

After creating the report, it's uploaded as an artifact which you can later
download and evaluate. The merge request widget also displays any security
warnings.

To learn more, see [Secret Detection](../../user/application_security/secret_detection/index.md).

## Auto Dependency Scanning **(ULTIMATE)**

> Introduced in [GitLab Ultimate](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/) 10.7.

Dependency Scanning uses the
[Dependency Scanning Docker image](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/dependency-scanning)
to run analysis on the project dependencies and check for potential security issues.
The Auto Dependency Scanning stage is skipped on licenses other than
[Ultimate](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/) and requires
[GitLab Runner](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/) 11.5 or above.

After creating the report, it's uploaded as an artifact which you can later download and
check out. The merge request widget displays any security warnings detected,

To learn more about
[Dependency Scanning](../../user/application_security/dependency_scanning/index.md),
see the documentation.

## Auto License Compliance **(ULTIMATE)**

> Introduced in [GitLab Ultimate](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/) 11.0.

License Compliance uses the
[License Compliance Docker image](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/license-finder)
to search the project dependencies for their license. The Auto License Compliance stage
is skipped on licenses other than [Ultimate](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/).

After creating the report, it's uploaded as an artifact which you can later download and
check out. The merge request displays any detected licenses.

To learn more about
[License Compliance](../../user/compliance/license_compliance/index.md), see the
documentation.

## Auto Container Scanning **(ULTIMATE)**

> Introduced in GitLab 10.4.

Vulnerability Static Analysis for containers uses [Clair](https://github.com/quay/clair)
to check for potential security issues on Docker images. The Auto Container Scanning
stage is skipped on licenses other than [Ultimate](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/).

After creating the report, it's uploaded as an artifact which you can later download and
check out. The merge request displays any detected security issues.

To learn more about
[Container Scanning](../../user/application_security/container_scanning/index.md),
see the documentation.

## Auto Review Apps

This is an optional step, since many projects don't have a Kubernetes cluster
available. If the [requirements](requirements.md) are not met, the job is
silently skipped.

[Review Apps](../../ci/review_apps/index.md) are temporary application environments based on the
branch's code so developers, designers, QA, product managers, and other
reviewers can actually see and interact with code changes as part of the review
process. Auto Review Apps create a Review App for each branch.

Auto Review Apps deploy your application to your Kubernetes cluster only. If no cluster
is available, no deployment occurs.

The Review App has a unique URL based on a combination of the project ID, the branch
or tag name, a unique number, and the Auto DevOps base domain, such as
`13083-review-project-branch-123456.example.com`. The merge request widget displays
a link to the Review App for easy discovery. When the branch or tag is deleted,
such as after merging a merge request, the Review App is also deleted.

Review apps are deployed using the
[auto-deploy-app](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cluster-integration/auto-deploy-image/-/tree/master/assets/auto-deploy-app) chart with
Helm, which you can [customize](customize.md#custom-helm-chart). The application deploys
into the [Kubernetes namespace](../../user/project/clusters/index.md#deployment-variables)
for the environment.

In GitLab 11.4 and later, [local Tiller](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/merge_requests/22036) is
used. Previous versions of GitLab had a Tiller installed in the project
namespace.

CAUTION: **Caution:**
Your apps should *not* be manipulated outside of Helm (using Kubernetes directly).
This can cause confusion with Helm not detecting the change and subsequent
deploys with Auto DevOps can undo your changes. Also, if you change something
and want to undo it by deploying again, Helm may not detect that anything changed
in the first place, and thus not realize that it needs to re-apply the old configuration.

## Auto DAST **(ULTIMATE)**

> Introduced in [GitLab Ultimate](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/) 10.4.

Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) uses the popular open source tool
[OWASP ZAProxy](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy) to analyze the current code
and check for potential security issues. The Auto DAST stage is skipped on
licenses other than [Ultimate](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/).

- On your default branch, DAST scans an application deployed specifically for that purpose
  unless you [override the target branch](#overriding-the-dast-target).
  The app is deleted after DAST has run.
- On feature branches, DAST scans the [review app](#auto-review-apps).

After the DAST scan completes, any security warnings are displayed
on the [Security Dashboard](../../user/application_security/security_dashboard/index.md)
and the merge request widget.

To learn more about
[Dynamic Application Security Testing](../../user/application_security/dast/index.md),
see the documentation.

### Overriding the DAST target

To use a custom target instead of the auto-deployed review apps,
set a `DAST_WEBSITE` environment variable to the URL for DAST to scan.

DANGER: **Warning:**
If [DAST Full Scan](../../user/application_security/dast/index.md#full-scan) is
enabled, GitLab strongly advises **not**
to set `DAST_WEBSITE` to any staging or production environment. DAST Full Scan
actively attacks the target, which can take down your application and lead to
data loss or corruption.

### Disabling Auto DAST

You can disable DAST:

- On all branches by setting the `DAST_DISABLED` environment variable to `"true"`.
- Only on the default branch by setting the `DAST_DISABLED_FOR_DEFAULT_BRANCH`
  environment variable to `"true"`.
- Only on feature branches by setting `REVIEW_DISABLED` environment variable to
  `"true"`. This also disables the Review App.

## Auto Browser Performance Testing **(PREMIUM)**

> Introduced in [GitLab Premium](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/) 10.4.

Auto [Browser Performance Testing](../../user/project/merge_requests/browser_performance_testing.md)
measures the browser performance of a web page with the
[Sitespeed.io container](https://hub.docker.com/r/sitespeedio/sitespeed.io/),
creates a JSON report including the overall performance score for each page, and
uploads the report as an artifact. By default, it tests the root page of your Review and
Production environments. If you want to test additional URLs, add the paths to a
file named `.gitlab-urls.txt` in the root directory, one file per line. For example:

```plaintext
/
/features
/direction
```

Any browser performance differences between the source and target branches are also
[shown in the merge request widget](../../user/project/merge_requests/browser_performance_testing.md).

## Auto Load Performance Testing **(PREMIUM)**

> Introduced in [GitLab Premium](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/) 13.2.

Auto [Load Performance Testing](../../user/project/merge_requests/load_performance_testing.md)
measures the server performance of an application with the
[k6 container](https://hub.docker.com/r/loadimpact/k6/),
creates a JSON report including several key result metrics, and
uploads the report as an artifact.

Some initial setup is required. A [k6](https://k6.io/) test needs to be
written that's tailored to your specific application. The test also needs to be
configured so it can pick up the environment's dynamic URL via an environment variable.

Any load performance test result differences between the source and target branches are also
[shown in the merge request widget](../../user/project/merge_requests/load_performance_testing.md).

## Auto Deploy

This is an optional step, since many projects don't have a Kubernetes cluster
available. If the [requirements](requirements.md) are not met, the job is skipped.

After a branch or merge request is merged into the project's default branch (usually
`master`), Auto Deploy deploys the application to a `production` environment in
the Kubernetes cluster, with a namespace based on the project name and unique
project ID, such as `project-4321`.

Auto Deploy does not include deployments to staging or canary environments by
default, but the
[Auto DevOps template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Auto-DevOps.gitlab-ci.yml)
contains job definitions for these tasks if you want to enable them.

You can use [environment variables](customize.md#environment-variables) to automatically
scale your pod replicas, and to apply custom arguments to the Auto DevOps `helm upgrade`
commands. This is an easy way to
[customize the Auto Deploy Helm chart](customize.md#custom-helm-chart).

Helm uses the [auto-deploy-app](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cluster-integration/auto-deploy-image/-/tree/master/assets/auto-deploy-app)
chart to deploy the application into the
[Kubernetes namespace](../../user/project/clusters/index.md#deployment-variables)
for the environment.

In GitLab 11.4 and later, a
[local Tiller](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/merge_requests/22036) is
used. Previous versions of GitLab had a Tiller installed in the project
namespace.

CAUTION: **Caution:**
Your apps should *not* be manipulated outside of Helm (using Kubernetes directly).
This can cause confusion with Helm not detecting the change and subsequent
deploys with Auto DevOps can undo your changes. Also, if you change something
and want to undo it by deploying again, Helm may not detect that anything changed
in the first place, and thus not realize that it needs to re-apply the old configuration.

### GitLab deploy tokens

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/merge_requests/19507) in GitLab 11.0.

[GitLab Deploy Tokens](../../user/project/deploy_tokens/index.md#gitlab-deploy-token)
are created for internal and private projects when Auto DevOps is enabled, and the
Auto DevOps settings are saved. You can use a Deploy Token for permanent access to
the registry. After you manually revoke the GitLab Deploy Token, it won't be
automatically created.

If the GitLab Deploy Token can't be found, `CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD` is
used.

NOTE: **Note:**
`CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD` is only valid during deployment. Kubernetes will be able
to successfully pull the container image during deployment, but if the image must
be pulled again, such as after pod eviction, Kubernetes will fail to do so
as it attempts to fetch the image using `CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD`.

### Kubernetes 1.16+

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/auto-deploy-app/-/merge_requests/51) in GitLab 12.8.
> - Support for deploying a PostgreSQL version that supports Kubernetes 1.16+ was [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cluster-integration/auto-deploy-image/-/merge_requests/49) in GitLab 12.9.
> - Supported out of the box for new deployments as of GitLab 13.0.

CAUTION: **Deprecation:**
The default value for the `deploymentApiVersion` setting was changed from
`extensions/v1beta` to `apps/v1` in [GitLab 13.0](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/auto-deploy-app/-/issues/47).

In Kubernetes 1.16 and later, a number of
[APIs were removed](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2019/07/18/api-deprecations-in-1-16/),
including support for `Deployment` in the `extensions/v1beta1` version.

To use Auto Deploy on a Kubernetes 1.16+ cluster:

1. If you are deploying your application for the first time on GitLab 13.0 or
   newer, no configuration should be required.

1. On GitLab 12.10 or older, set the following in the [`.gitlab/auto-deploy-values.yaml` file](customize.md#customize-values-for-helm-chart):

   ```yaml
   deploymentApiVersion: apps/v1
   ```

1. If you have an in-cluster PostgreSQL database installed with
   `AUTO_DEVOPS_POSTGRES_CHANNEL` set to `1`, follow the [guide to upgrade
   PostgreSQL](upgrading_postgresql.md).

1. If you are deploying your application for the first time and are using
   GitLab 12.9 or 12.10, set `AUTO_DEVOPS_POSTGRES_CHANNEL` to `2`.

DANGER: **Warning:**
On GitLab 12.9 and 12.10, opting into
`AUTO_DEVOPS_POSTGRES_CHANNEL` version `2` deletes the version `1` PostgreSQL
database. Follow the [guide to upgrading PostgreSQL](upgrading_postgresql.md)
to back up and restore your database before opting into version `2` (On
GitLab 13.0, an additional variable is required to trigger the database
deletion).

### Migrations

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/merge_requests/21955) in GitLab 11.4

You can configure database initialization and migrations for PostgreSQL to run
within the application pod by setting the project variables `DB_INITIALIZE` and
`DB_MIGRATE` respectively.

If present, `DB_INITIALIZE` is run as a shell command within an application pod
as a Helm post-install hook. As some applications can't run without a successful
database initialization step, GitLab deploys the first release without the
application deployment, and only the database initialization step. After the database
initialization completes, GitLab deploys a second release with the application
deployment as normal.

Note that a post-install hook means that if any deploy succeeds,
`DB_INITIALIZE` won't be processed thereafter.

If present, `DB_MIGRATE` is run as a shell command within an application pod as
a Helm pre-upgrade hook.

For example, in a Rails application in an image built with
[Herokuish](https://github.com/gliderlabs/herokuish):

- `DB_INITIALIZE` can be set to `RAILS_ENV=production /bin/herokuish procfile exec bin/rails db:setup`
- `DB_MIGRATE` can be set to `RAILS_ENV=production /bin/herokuish procfile exec bin/rails db:migrate`

Unless your repository contains a `Dockerfile`, your image is built with
Herokuish, and you must prefix commands run in these images with
`/bin/herokuish procfile exec` (for Herokuish) or `/cnb/lifecycle/launcher`
(for Cloud Native Buildpacks) to replicate the environment where your
application runs.

### Upgrade auto-deploy-app Chart

You can upgrade the auto-deploy-app chart by following the [upgrade guide](upgrading_auto_deploy_dependencies.md).

### Workers

Some web applications must run extra deployments for "worker processes". For
example, Rails applications commonly use separate worker processes
to run background tasks like sending emails.

The [default Helm chart](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cluster-integration/auto-deploy-image/-/tree/master/assets/auto-deploy-app)
used in Auto Deploy
[has support for running worker processes](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/auto-deploy-app/-/merge_requests/9).

To run a worker, you must ensure the worker can respond to
the standard health checks, which expect a successful HTTP response on port
`5000`. For [Sidekiq](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq), you can use
the [`sidekiq_alive` gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/sidekiq_alive).

To work with Sidekiq, you must also ensure your deployments have
access to a Redis instance. Auto DevOps won't deploy this instance for you, so
you must:

- Maintain your own Redis instance.
- Set a CI variable `K8S_SECRET_REDIS_URL`, which is the URL of this instance,
  to ensure it's passed into your deployments.

After configuring your worker to respond to health checks, run a Sidekiq
worker for your Rails application. You can enable workers by setting the
following in the [`.gitlab/auto-deploy-values.yaml` file](customize.md#customize-values-for-helm-chart):

```yaml
workers:
  sidekiq:
    replicaCount: 1
    command:
      - /bin/herokuish
      - procfile
      - exec
      - sidekiq
    preStopCommand:
      - /bin/herokuish
      - procfile
      - exec
      - sidekiqctl
      - quiet
    terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 60
```

### Network Policy

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/auto-deploy-app/-/merge_requests/30) in GitLab 12.7.

By default, all Kubernetes pods are
[non-isolated](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/#isolated-and-non-isolated-pods),
and accept traffic to and from any source. You can use
[NetworkPolicy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/)
to restrict connections to and from selected pods, namespaces, and the Internet.

NOTE: **Note:**
You must use a Kubernetes network plugin that implements support for
`NetworkPolicy`. The default network plugin for Kubernetes (`kubenet`)
[does not implement](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/compute-storage-net/network-plugins/#kubenet)
support for it. The [Cilium](https://cilium.io/) network plugin can be
installed as a [cluster application](../../user/clusters/applications.md#install-cilium-using-gitlab-cicd)
to enable support for network policies.

You can enable deployment of a network policy by setting the following
in the `.gitlab/auto-deploy-values.yaml` file:

```yaml
networkPolicy:
  enabled: true
```

The default policy deployed by the Auto Deploy pipeline allows
traffic within a local namespace, and from the `gitlab-managed-apps`
namespace. All other inbound connections are blocked. Outbound
traffic (for example, to the Internet) is not affected by the default policy.

You can also provide a custom [policy specification](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/)
in the `.gitlab/auto-deploy-values.yaml` file, for example:

```yaml
networkPolicy:
  enabled: true
  spec:
    podSelector:
      matchLabels:
        app.gitlab.com/env: staging
    ingress:
      - from:
        - podSelector:
            matchLabels: {}
        - namespaceSelector:
            matchLabels:
              app.gitlab.com/managed_by: gitlab
```

For more information on installing Network Policies, see
[Install Cilium using GitLab CI/CD](../../user/clusters/applications.md#install-cilium-using-gitlab-cicd).

### Web Application Firewall (ModSecurity) customization

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/auto-deploy-app/-/merge_requests/44) in GitLab 12.8.

Customization on an [Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/)
or on a deployment base is available for clusters with
[ModSecurity installed](../../user/clusters/applications.md#web-application-firewall-modsecurity).

To enable ModSecurity with Auto Deploy, you must create a `.gitlab/auto-deploy-values.yaml`
file in your project with the following attributes.

|Attribute | Description | Default |
-----------|-------------|---------|
|`enabled` | Enables custom configuration for ModSecurity, defaulting to the [Core Rule Set](https://coreruleset.org/) | `false` |
|`secRuleEngine` | Configures the [rules engine](https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity/wiki/Reference-Manual-(v2.x)#secruleengine) | `DetectionOnly` |
|`secRules` | Creates one or more additional [rule](https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity/wiki/Reference-Manual-(v2.x)#SecRule) | `nil` |

In the following `auto-deploy-values.yaml` example, some custom settings
are enabled for ModSecurity. Those include setting its engine to
process rules instead of only logging them, while adding two specific
header-based rules:

```yaml
ingress:
  modSecurity:
    enabled: true
    secRuleEngine: "On"
    secRules:
      - variable: "REQUEST_HEADERS:User-Agent"
        operator: "printer"
        action: "log,deny,id:'2010',status:403,msg:'printer is an invalid agent'"
      - variable: "REQUEST_HEADERS:Content-Type"
        operator: "text/plain"
        action: "log,deny,id:'2011',status:403,msg:'Text is not supported as content type'"
```

### Running commands in the container

Applications built with [Auto Build](#auto-build) using Herokuish, the default
unless your repository contains [a custom Dockerfile](#auto-build-using-a-dockerfile),
may require commands to be wrapped as follows:

```shell
/bin/herokuish procfile exec $COMMAND
```

Some of the reasons you may need to wrap commands:

- Attaching using `kubectl exec`.
- Using GitLab's [Web Terminal](../../ci/environments/index.md#web-terminals).

For example, to start a Rails console from the application root directory, run:

```shell
/bin/herokuish procfile exec bin/rails c
```

When using Cloud Native Buildpacks, instead of `/bin/herokuish procfile exec`, use

```shell
/cnb/lifecycle/launcher $COMMAND
```

## Auto Monitoring

After your application deploys, Auto Monitoring helps you monitor
your application's server and response metrics right out of the box. Auto
Monitoring uses [Prometheus](../../user/project/integrations/prometheus.md) to
retrieve system metrics, such as CPU and memory usage, directly from
[Kubernetes](../../user/project/integrations/prometheus_library/kubernetes.md),
and response metrics, such as HTTP error rates, latency, and throughput, from the
[NGINX server](../../user/project/integrations/prometheus_library/nginx_ingress.md).

The metrics include:

- **Response Metrics:** latency, throughput, error rate
- **System Metrics:** CPU utilization, memory utilization

GitLab provides some initial alerts for you after you install Prometheus:

- Ingress status code `500` > 0.1%
- NGINX status code `500` > 0.1%

To use Auto Monitoring:

1. [Install and configure the Auto DevOps requirements](requirements.md).
1. [Enable Auto DevOps](index.md#enablingdisabling-auto-devops), if you haven't done already.
1. Navigate to your project's **{rocket}** **CI/CD > Pipelines** and click **Run Pipeline**.
1. After the pipeline finishes successfully, open the
   [monitoring dashboard for a deployed environment](../../ci/environments/index.md#monitoring-environments)
   to view the metrics of your deployed application. To view the metrics of the
   whole Kubernetes cluster, navigate to **Operations > Metrics**.

## Auto Code Intelligence

> [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/216438) in GitLab 13.5.

[GitLab code intelligence](../../user/project/code_intelligence.md) adds
code navigation features common to interactive development environments (IDE),
including type signatures, symbol documentation, and go-to definition. It's powered by
[LSIF](https://lsif.dev/) and available for Auto DevOps projects using Go language only.
GitLab plans to add support for more languages as more LSIF indexers become available.
You can follow the [code intelligence epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4212)
for updates.

This stage is enabled by default. You can disable it by adding the
`CODE_INTELLIGENCE_DISABLED` environment variable. Read more about
[disabling Auto DevOps jobs](../../topics/autodevops/customize.md#disable-jobs).
