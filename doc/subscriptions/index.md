# GitLab subscription **(STARTER)**

GitLab offers tiers of features. Your subscription determines which tier you
have access to. Subscriptions are valid for 12 months.

GitLab provides special subscriptions to participants in:

- [Education](#gitlab-for-education-subscriptions)
- [Open Source](#gitlab-for-open-source-subscriptions)

## Choose a GitLab subscription

When choosing a subscription, there are two factors to consider:

- [GitLab.com or self-managed](#choose-between-gitlabcom-or-self-managed)
- [GitLab tier](#choose-a-gitlab-tier)

### Choose between GitLab.com or self-managed

There are some differences in how a subscription applies, depending if you use
GitLab.com or a self-managed instance:

- [GitLab.com](gitlab_com/index.md): GitLab's software-as-a-service offering.
  You don't need to install anything to use GitLab.com, you only need to
  [sign up](https://gitlab.com/users/sign_up) and start using GitLab straight away.
- [GitLab self-managed](self_managed/index.md): Install, administer, and maintain
  your own GitLab instance.

On a self-managed instance, a GitLab subscription provides the same set of
features for _all_ users. On GitLab.com, you can apply a subscription to either
a group or a personal namespace.

NOTE: **Note:**
Subscriptions cannot be transferred between GitLab.com and GitLab self-managed.
A new subscription must be purchased and applied as needed.

### Choose a GitLab tier

Pricing is [tier-based](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/), allowing you to choose
the features which fit your budget. For information on what features are available
at each tier for each product, see:

- [GitLab.com feature comparison](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/gitlab-com/feature-comparison/)
- [Self-managed feature comparison](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/self-managed/feature-comparison/)

## Contact Support

Learn more about:

- The tiers of [GitLab Support](https://about.gitlab.com/support/).
- [Submit a request via the Support Portal](https://support.gitlab.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).

We also encourage all users to search our project trackers for known issues and
existing feature requests in the
[GitLab project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/).

These issues are the best avenue for getting updates on specific product plans
and for communicating directly with the relevant GitLab team members.

<!-- ## Troubleshooting

Include any troubleshooting steps that you can foresee. If you know beforehand what issues
one might have when setting this up, or when something is changed, or on upgrading, it's
important to describe those, too. Think of things that may go wrong and include them here.
This is important to minimize requests for support, and to avoid doc comments with
questions that you know someone might ask.

Each scenario can be a third-level heading, e.g. `### Getting error message X`.
If you have none to add when creating a doc, leave this section in place
but commented out to help encourage others to add to it in the future. -->
